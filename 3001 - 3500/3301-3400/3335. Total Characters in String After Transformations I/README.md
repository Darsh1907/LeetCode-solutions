```
Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2
Output: 7
Explanation:
First Transformation (t = 1):
'a' becomes 'b'
'b' becomes 'c'
'c' becomes 'd'
'y' becomes 'z'
'y' becomes 'z'
String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
Second Transformation (t = 2):
'b' becomes 'c'
'c' becomes 'd'
'd' becomes 'e'
'z' becomes "ab"
'z' becomes "ab"
String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.
```

Example 2:
