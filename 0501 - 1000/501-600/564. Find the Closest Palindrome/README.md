# 564. Find the Closest Palindrome
## (Hard)

Given a string `n` representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return **the smaller one**.

The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = "123"
Output: "121"
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = "1"
Output: "0"
Explanation: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= n.length <= 18`
- `n` consists of only digits.
- `n` does not have leading zeros.
- `n` is representing an integer in the range `[1, 10^18 - 1]`.

- **Hint1:** Will brute force work for this problem? Think of something else.
- **Hint2:** Take some examples like 1234, 999,1000, etc and check their closest palindromes. How many different cases are possible?
- **Hint3:** Do we have to consider only left half or right half of the string or both?
- **Hint4:** Try to find the closest palindrome of these numbers- 12932, 99800, 12120. Did you observe something?
