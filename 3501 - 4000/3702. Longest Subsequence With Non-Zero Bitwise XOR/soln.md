## Approach: Classification Discussion

### Intuition

The XOR operation has the following three properties:

```
1. XORing any number with 0 results in the original number, i.e., a⊕0=a.
2. XORing any number with itself results in 0, i.e., a⊕a=0.
3. The XOR operation satisfies the commutative and associative laws, i.e., a⊕b=b⊕a and a⊕(b⊕c)=(a⊕b)⊕c.

Here, ⊕ denotes the XOR operator.
```

Let `n` be the length of the array `nums`. Clearly, the answer cannot exceed `n`.

Let the bitwise XOR of all elements in the array be `totalXor`.

**Case 1:** totalXor != 0

In this case, the entire array nums itself is a non-empty subsequence whose bitwise XOR is non-zero. Therefore, the answer is n.

**Case 2:** totalXor=0 and all elements in nums are 0

In this case, the bitwise XOR of any non-empty subsequence is 0. Therefore, there is no non-empty subsequence whose bitwise XOR is non-zero, so the answer is 0.

**Case 3:** totalXor=0 and there exists at least one element x != 0 in nums

Since totalXor=0 and x!=0, there must be at least one other element in nums.

Let the bitwise XOR of the remaining n−1 elements be subXor. Then:

`x⊕subXor=totalXor=0`

XORing both sides with x, we get:

`x⊕subXor⊕x=0⊕x`

Using the properties of the XOR operation, we obtain:

`subXor=x!=0`

Therefore, after removing the element `x`, the remaining `n−1` elements form a subsequence whose bitwise XOR is non-zero. Hence, the answer is `n−1`.

**Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int totalXor = 0;
        bool allZero = true;

        for (int x : nums) {
            totalXor ^= x;
            if (x > 0) {
                allZero = false;
            }
        }

        if (totalXor > 0) {
            return n;
        }

        return allZero ? 0 : n - 1;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the array nums.

- Time complexity: O(n).
- Space complexity: O(1).
