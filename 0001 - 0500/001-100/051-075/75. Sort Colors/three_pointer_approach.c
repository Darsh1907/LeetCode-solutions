// We’ll use a three-pointer approach to solve this problem

// The three-pointers will be: current, zeroPos and twoPos.:
// current - This will hold the position of the current element that we’re on during the iteration of the array. This will be initialised to 0.
// zeroPos - This will hold the index where we will push any 0s that we may encounter. This will be initialised to 0.
// twoPos - This will hold the index where we will push any 2s that we may encounter. This will be initialised to n - 1, where n is the size of the array.

// We’ll iterate through the array using the current pointer. Every element is either 0, 1 or 2 so let’s see what we’ll be doing in each of these cases:
// If arr[current] = 0 - In this case, we need to push the element towards the front of the array.
// To do that we can swap arr[current] and arr[zeroPos], then we will increase both current and zeroPos by 1.
// If arr[current] = 1 - In this case, we will just increase the current by 1, since we are only concerned with push 0s to the front and 2s to the end of the array.
// If arr[current] = 2 - In this case, we need to push the element towards the end of the array. Again, to do this, we’ll just swap arr[current] and arr[twoPos]. 
// We will decrease twoPos by 1. However, in this case, we will not increase the current by 1.


// What will be the condition that must be satisfied so that our loop can end? 
// You might think that it’s when current reaches the end of the array but that’s not the case here. 
// Let’s see why. Can you see what exactly the two pointers, zeroPos and twoPos are doing? 
// As we go through the array, every element before zeroPos is a 0 and every element after twoPos is a 2. 
// Also, every element after zeroPos but before the current is a 1. Therefore, all these elements are ‘sorted’. 
// The element that remains to be sorted is the ones that lie between the indices current and twoPos. 
// Therefore our loop will terminate when the current reaches the value of twoPos.


// Now, let’s understand why we can’t increase the value of current when arr[current] = 2. 
// When we swap arr[current] with arr[twoPos], we don’t know what value was initially at index twoPos (before the swap happened), it could be any of the values 0, 1, or 2. 
// So, we can’t increase the value of current without checking what value was swapped with twoPos. 
// We didn’t have to worry about this in the case where we were swapping arr[current] with arr[zeroPos] because then we would always be swapping 0 and 1.

// Time Complexity:
// O(N), where ‘N’ is the size of the array.

// We are only doing a Single Pass of the array.  So Overall Time Complexity is O(N).

// Space Complexity:
// O(1), As we are using constant space.
