/*
Let's take some good examples :
number->binary form
3->0000 0011
4->0000 0100
5->0000 0101
6->0000 0110
7->0000 0111
8->0000 1000
*/

// The observation we can conclude is that the number which is a power of two has always exactly 1 true bit.

/*
Now consider :-
bit representation of 7  -> 0111
bit representation of 8  -> 1000
bitwise AND of 7 and 8 -> 0000
we are gonna use this property for for all numbers which are powers of two
