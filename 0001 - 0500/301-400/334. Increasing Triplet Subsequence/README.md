The problem asks whether there exists an increasing triplet subsequence in the given array nums. An increasing triplet subsequence is a sequence of three numbers (i, j, k) such that 0 â‰¤ i < j < k < n and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k], where n is the length of the array.

Here's how the provided code works step by step:

1. Initialize two variables first and second with the maximum possible integer value (INT_MAX). These variables will keep track of the smallest and second smallest elements encountered so far.

2. Loop through each element num in the nums array:

3. If num is less than or equal to the value of first, update the value of first to num. This means we've found a potential candidate for the first element of the increasing triplet.
If num is greater than first but less than or equal to second, update the value of second to num. This means we've found a potential candidate for the second element of the increasing triplet.
If num is greater than both first and second, it means we've found a third element that is greater than both the first and second elements. This satisfies the condition for an increasing triplet subsequence, so we return true.

4. If the loop finishes without finding an increasing triplet subsequence, we return false.

The key idea behind this solution is to maintain two variables (first and second) that represent the smallest and second smallest elements encountered so far. As we iterate through the array, we update these variables based on the conditions explained above. If at any point we find a third element that is greater than both first and second, we know we have an increasing triplet subsequence and return true. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding such a subsequence, we return false.

In essence, the algorithm is trying to find three numbers that satisfy the increasing triplet subsequence condition while maintaining the smallest and second smallest candidates encountered so far. This approach ensures a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
